A teeny-tiny package to create stream processing workloads. It is intended to be used with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).  

## Getting Started

There are only a few packages that help Gophers to create stream processing workloads. This package is one of them. It is intended to be used with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Supported:

* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* [nats.io](https://nats.io/) (experimental)

```bash
go get github.com/ionos-cloud/streams
```

It features a channel based API to consume messages from a Kafka topic and a channel based API to produce messages to a Kafka topic. It assumes the use of a [consumer group](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/consumer.html#:~:text=A%20consumer%20group%20is%20a,proportional%20share%20of%20the%20partitions.) for the consumption of messages.

There is a `source` which feeds messages from a source into a stream. There is a `sink` which writes processed messages into a data sink.

When using a `sink` in the procesing the commit mode can be set to `CommitManual` which means that the `sink` will not commit the offset of the consumed message. This is useful when the message is processed in a stream and the offset should only be committed after the message has been processed.

The package connects a `source` with a sink via small functional operatios.

* `Branch`
* `Do`
* `FanOut`
* `Filter`
* `Log`
* `Map`
* `Merge`
* `Table` (experimental) Stores the message in a table. The table can be queried via a `View`.

There is support for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics.

The `view` package provides the ability to create views with data from the stream processing workload.
